# Chapter Performance Awards (1962-2006)

In 1962, National Council began recognizing the top ten chapters for their
rating in overall performance as measured by scholarship, campus
activities, financial stability, alumni relations, and house activity.
Starting in 1976, the rating was made automatically on the basis of data
routinely submitted by undergraduate officers.  Colonies were added in
1977 and alumni corporations were added in 1978, finally making it truly a
chapter evaluation.

The first time a chapter won, it received a
triangular wall plaque and an engraved pendant indicating rating and
school year.  Successive ratings and years in which they are won are
recognized by additional pendants.
